# Montrosa'sPoster Tributes

A project developed after the course DH-404 Cultural Data Sculpting at EPFL.

Our experience aims to pioneer in the cutting edge field of mixing artistic heritage, AI generative models and human creativity. The immersive and interesting AI-human interaction we bring to our audience pays tribute to the artists' work and life through the narrative of Montrosa.
It start after we designed a high-fidelity prototype in Figma that incorporates the visual style of Montreux Jazz Festival 

We are hoping to have a real impact by developing a web-based version and show it at the Festival this year.
